<h1>Phase 3: model improvement with inflow and wake observations<a class="headerlink" href="#phase-3-model-improvement-with-inflow-and-wake-observations" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Slides that show phase 2 results can be downloaded <a class="reference external" href="https://app.box.com/s/kf9i4fzy9qqzhagf8ozpv8nty48n8zpa">here</a>.</p>
<p>In phase 3, The team releases ALL the inflow and wake observations and all King Plains SCADA to the benchmark participants.
The participants leverage the additional inputs and what learnt in Phase 1 and 2 to simulate the wakes from the King Plains and Armadillo Flats wind plants.
The benchmark team then compares the simulated results with the observed values and summarizes results in a journal article.</p>
<p>Please read the instructions below in detail.</p>
<p>Phase 3 officially starts on 13 March 2024, when results from Phase 2 are released. Participants are expected to submit results for Phase 3 (as specified below) by 30 April 2025.</p>

Please DO change the temporal dimension in the template to match that of your model output. If your model output is available at really high frequency, such that the file to submit would become too big, please do NOT calculate averages, and just submit instantaneous data at whatever time resolution you feel comfortable submitting results at. Please only submit TI and TKE if your model directly outputs them. If that is the case, please specify in the .txt file above how they are calculated (averaging time, center of the window, etc.). If your model does NOT directly calculate TI and TKE, please do NOT provide them in the submitted file, and we will calculate them ourselves whenever possible to ensure consistency.
